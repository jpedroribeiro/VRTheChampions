# VRTheChampions

WebVR + WebAR playground. Not much to see here apart from some _hello worlds_ and basic implementations.

To view some examples you might need to run `serve` and open your localhost.

Or you might want to have a look at the [presentation](https://github.com/jpedroribeiro/VRTheChampions/blob/master/VR%20the%20champions%20-%20presentation.pptx)

Playing with:
 - [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) library
 - [ReactVR](https://facebook.github.io/react-vr/)
 - [AR.js](https://medium.com/arjs) for A-Frame
